AB During a 5-year study of a marked population of mountain goats
   (Oreamnos americanus) in west-central Alberta, 5 of 17 females produced
   their first kid at 4 years of age, while most females did not reproduce
   until 5 years of age. Twinning accounted for 2% of births. Survival of
   kids to 1 year averaged 60%, and survival of females from 1 to 4 years
   of age was 52%. Most deaths of kids occurred in September-November and
   appeared due to predation by wolves (Canis lupus), cougars (Felis
   concolor), and grizzly bears (UI sw arctos). At least half of the
   yearlings lost from the population were preyed upon, but losses of
   2-year-olds were concentrated in the summer, suggesting emigration.
   Survival rates of young goats were not different according to sex. We
   suggest that nutrient availability limits the reproductive performance
   of the goats by retarding their growth, while predation on young goats
   is a major source of mortality.

TI MALE AND FEMALE MATING COMPETITION IN WOLVES - FEMALE SUPPRESSION VS

SO BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; CANIS-LUPUS; PLAINS; WOLF; EVOLUTION; MONOGAMY;
   MAMMALS; ECOLOGY; JACKAL
AB The social organization of wolves is characterised by strong pairbond
   associations. Groups may consist of a mating couple and their remaining
   offspring or of an association of potentially reproductive adults. When
   a pack consists of several adults, intrasexual mating competition and
   intersexual partner preference are expected to play an important role
   in the establishment of sexual relationships. Data from the wild show
   that as a rule only one female in a pack gives birth. Female
   suppression is assumed to prevent the other pack members from breeding.
   Our main interest was to elucidate the proximate behavioural mechanisms
   by which the socio-sexual relationships are structured in times of the
   mating season. Special attention was paid to the influence of
   differences in dominance status and sex on the competitive interactions
   between pack members.
   From 1977 to 1985 we studied the social behaviour of wolves in and
   around the mating season at Burger's Zoo in Arnhem (the Netherlands) by
   means of detailed observations on two wolf packs.
   Together with a general rise in frequency of (sexuo-affiliative)
   interactions we observed an increase in general aggression and in the
   frequency of interventions during the mating season. Our results reveal
   certain differences in male and female mating strategies. 1) Separative
   interventions were observed predominantly in males and were directed
   against male-female sexual interactions, while such interventions by
   females were less apparent. 2) Males showed a high frequency of
   intrasexual aggression but only during the mating season. By contrast,
   females showed less intrasexual aggression, and instead, showed a high
   level of intrasexual dominance display, especially the alpha-female,
   and they did so both in and outside the mating season. 3) Males tended
   to intervene in especially those intersexual contacts in which their
   own preferred female was involved, whereas the intolerance of the
   alpha-female was more general, i.e. it was shown with respect to all
   manifestations of other females. These patterns clearly explain why in
   free nature wolf social organization tends towards a multi-male
   uni-female system in which the non-dominant males have little chance of
   sexual contact, but are generally tolerated as helpers in brood care.
   In conclusion, male competition was comparatively more context-related
   while female competition took the form of unprovoked hostility.

AB A mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (Zoletil(R)) was used to
   immobilize 29 captive born Iberian wolves. Based on their excitability
   during handling procedures the animals were categorized as excited (n =
   15) and unexcited (n = 14). We observed differences in the responses of
   these groups to the drugs. Although immobilized with higher doses (mean
   +/- SD of 6.94 +/- 2.13 versus 5.04 +/- 1.74 mg/kg for the unexcited)
   the excited individuals had an irregular and less predictable response,
   with five individuals needing additional dosages in the excited group
   compared to one animal in the unexcited group. Arousal time and
   duration of immobilization of excited wolves was not correlated to
   initial drug doses, but was in unexcited animals; the excited group had
   a poorer thermal regulation. Differences in arousal time and duration
   could be the a result of the different doses used. Excited wolves were
   older than unexcited (5.4 +/- 3.01 versus 2.86 +/- 2.11 years,
   respectively). For captive wolves, doses of about 5 mg/kg are
   recommended for non-excited and 10 mg/kg for excited individuals.

AB Lynx Lynx lynx (Linnaeus, 1758) - ungulate relationships were studied
   in the exploited (530 km(2)) and pristine (47.5 km(2)) parts of
   Bialowieza Primeval Forest during 1985 through 1992. In pristine
   forest, Sus scrofa (54%) and Cervus elaphus (35%) predominated in the
   ungulate community. In exploited forest, C. elaphus (36%) and Capreolus
   capreolus (33%) were most abundant. Seat analysis indicated that
   cervids comprised 87% of biomass consumed by lynxes in the cold season;
   Lepus europaeus were 11%, and S. scrofa 2%. Hare was 2.5 times higher
   in the lynx diet in the exploited forest than in the pristine forest.
   Among 138 carcasses of ungulates killed by lynx in exploited forests in
   cold seasons, 76% were roe deer. In the pristine forests, red deer
   (61%) and roe deer (28%) were equally positively selected. Lynx did not
   select roe deer for any sex/age class but did select red deer fawns.
   Snowtracking showed that lynx attempted 1 attack on deer, 2 on
   medium-sized prey, and 6 on rodents in their daily route. Lynx fed an
   average of 3 - 4 days on a killed deer. Eight species of scavengers
   (mainly wild boar and red fox) fed on lynx's kills. Analysis of 1090
   ungulate carcasses found in Bialowieza Forest showed that predation was
   responsible for 75% of known natural mortality in red deer (66% by wolf
   Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758; 9% by lynx), 62% in roe deer (37% by lynx,
   25% by wolf), 27% in moose (all by wolf), and 12% in wild boar (11% by
   wolf, 1% by lynx). Review of studies from the Palaearctic region
   revealed that the share of hare in lynx diet positively correlated with
   latitude, whereas the share of ungulates was inversely related to
   latitude. From Palaearctic ungulates that ranged from 15 kg body mass
   (Moschus moschiferus) to 920 bg (male Bison bonasus), the lynx selected
   the smallest species available. Mean electivity index (D) for 9
   ungulate species was negatively correlated with their log body mass. In
   the Palaearctic region, predation contributed, on average, 1% to the
   natural mortality of European bison, 25% to that of wild boar, 59% of
   moose, 80% of red deer, and 85% of roe deer. Of total predation-caused
   mortality, the average share caused by lynx was 46% in roe deer, 14% in
   red deer and little or none in wild boar, moose, and bison.

   MATSCHIE)
SO REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL-ORGANIZATION; LONG-TERM; BEHAVIOR; HORSES
AB Attempts to account for the diversity of breeding systems in ungulates
   have concentrated on ruminants (Jarman, 1974), and non-ruminant
   species, like equids, were largely neglected. Equids are basically
   known to have two types of breeding systems correlated with two
   different types of resource distribution: Species living in mesic
   environments like mountain zebras, Equus zebra, (Penzhorn, 1984) and
   plain zebras, Equus burchelli, (Klingel, 1967) or feral horses (Berger,
   1986) all form small and permanent family groups, usually consisting of
   one male, one to two females and their offspring. Sometimes, two
   breeding stallions form coalitions (Berger, 1986), and small all-male
   groups occur in all three species. On the contrary, in species living
   in xeric and therefore unpredictable environments like African wild
   asses, Equus asinus, (Moehlman, 1974) and Grevy's zebra, Equus grevyi,
   (Ginsberg, 1987), dominant males are territorial and bonds exist only
   between females and. recent offspring, probably to minimize group-size
   while foraging. According to this classification based on resource
   distribution, Asian wild asses, Equus hemionus, ssp. should adopt the
   second type of social system. However, not all of them do so. Why is
   this not the case?
   Ressource distribution might not be the only determinant of breeding
   systems in equids. Apart from phylogenetic inertia mentioned for
   mountain and Grevy's zebras (Berger, 1988), predators might also play
   an important role. The Indian wild asses, Equus hemionus khur, (Shah,
   pers. comm.) living in xeric environments (with small and solitary
   hunting predators present, Canis lupus pallipes), typically adopt type
   2 breeding system. Bannikov's (1958) descriptive study already
   suggested that Mongolian kulans, Equus hemionus luteus, living in a
   similar desert-environment (together with large and cooperatively
   hunting predators, Canis lupus chance), might adopt type 1 breeding
   system. Our own observations on group-composition of kulans carried out
   in the Gobi National Park, during the breeding season and in winter,
   support this view. Not only were kulans found to be non-territorial and
   to live in family- or all-male groups like horses, plain and mountain
   zebras, but they doubled their group size in winter, at a time when
   food was more dispersed but predator pressure high. This contrast
   suggests that understanding differences in grouping patterns between
   subspecies of wild asses may help to shed light on equid social systems
   in general.

AB The diet of wolves Canis lupus Linnaeus, 1758 was studied from October
   1989 to November 1992 in the Bieszczady Mountains, southeastern Poland.
   A total of 221 wolf scats were collected and analyzed to determine the
   prey species consumed by wolves in each season. Cervids (red and roe
   deer) obviously predominated in wolf diet and consisted from 65% of
   winter biomass to 96% of summer biomass consumed. The red deer made up
   approximately 95% and roe deer only 5% of total cervid biomass
   consumed. During summer deer fawns made up 28% of total cervid biomass
   consumed. The wild boar constituted more significant food only during
   winter - 17% of biomass eaten. Among wild boars, piglets were selected
   and made up 66% of total wild boar biomass consumed during winter.
   Domestic livestock represented more significant food in winter (16% of
   biomass eaten) and was consumed as carrion laid out by hunters to bait
   wolves. Other food categories as hares, voles and insectivores played a
   negligible part in the wolf diet. Spring, summer and autumn diet were
   little diversified. Only winter diet differed significantly from other
   seasons for the presence of wild boar and cervids.

AB The role of predation on the endangered blackbuck antelope (Antelope

   Velavadar National Park, Gujarat, India, was evaluated in terms of
   ratios of predator to prey Food habits of wolves were determined from
   scat analysis and by direct observation Consumption was estimated from
   unutilized portions of blackbuck kills. Wolves preyed primarily on
   blackbuck (88% biomass consumption), rodents, and bares (Lepus
   nigricollis). Wolves consumed 4.62 (S.E. 0.11) kg/wolf/kill and made
   kills at an interval of 3.5 (SE 0.5) days. Daily consumption by wolves
   was estimated at 1.33 kg/wolf The number of blackbuck killed annually
   per wolf was estimated between 35 and 39. Between 142 to 158 blackbuck
   per wolf were considered essential to maintain a stable blackbuck
   population. Managing the grassland habitat by annual removal of the
   exotic shrub Prosopis juliflora, minimizing human disturbance to wolves
   at kills, and reducing predation on blackbuck by feral dogs were some
   ways to ensure continued viability of this wolf-blackbuck system

TI MODELING TERRITORIALITY AND WOLF DEER INTERACTIONS
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB WE propose here a mechanism for territorial pattern formation in wolves
   (Canis lupus) and analyse it using a spatially explicit mathematical
   model incorporating wolf movement and scent marking. Model results
   reflect field observations from northeastern Minnesota: buffer zones
   where wolves are scarce arise between adjacent packs, and near these
   buffer zones there are increased levels of scent marking1,2.
   Territories are arranged in a spatial mosaic (Fig. 1) which covers the
   wolf range. In the model formulation no assumptions are made about
   actual existence or extent of wolf territory and buffer zones; these
   arise naturally as stable steady-state solutions to the equations. We
   show mathematically how reduced predation by wolves in the buffer zones
   provides a refuge for prey species. Field studies support this;
   distribution of a primary prey species, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus), correlates negatively with that of wolves. Deer are found
   primarily in buffer zones3,4 (Fig. 2).

   National Park prompted an intensive study of radiocollared individuals
   in 1988-1991, complementing an ongoing study begun in 1958. During
   winter, 1959-1991, the proportion of lone wolves was higher when the
   population was at low levels, whereas average size of packs declined
   with density of wolves. Sizes of territories (1971-1991) were not
   related to size of packs. In winter, food availability (kg wolf-1
   day-1) and kill interval (days/kill) varied inversely with size of
   packs. Social relationships of radiocollared lone wolves were flexible;
   they often formed temporary groups of two or three wolves. Small groups
   (less than four) and lone wolves roamed large areas of the island (300
   km2 and 540 km2, respectively), frequently moving through territories
   of established packs. Solitary wolves and pairs readily killed adult
   moose, in contrast to a common belief that larger packs benefit from
   cooperative hunting.

AB During the last centuries many West European populations of wolf Canis
   lupus Linnaeus, 1758 and brown bear Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758 have
   been extirpated from most of their former ranges. Isolated populations
   of wolves (about 300 - 400 animals) and brown bears (about 80 - 100
   animals) actually survive in the Italian Apennines, while very few (5 -
   10) brown bears remain in the Italian eastern Alps. We have
   investigated the consequences of isolation, demographic decline, and
   random drift on genetic variability of the Italian populations of wolf
   and brown bear using restriction site analysis and nucleotide
   sequencing of portions of the mitochondrial genome. The studied
   sequences were homogeneous within-populations of both species, but
   there was a fixed difference in mtDNA between brown bears form the Alps
   and from the Apennines. Random drift since the time of isolation is a
   plausible explanation for both results. These findings suggest that
   wolves and bears have small effective population sizes and, thus, they
   will continue to loose genetic variability by random drift in the near
   future. Conservation efforts should be directed towards an increase of
   the annual growth rates of these populations. The individualization of
   discrete phylogeographic units in the brown bear suggests to manage
   them separately in order to preserve the existing gene diversity among
   populations.

SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Numerous cases of hereditary diseases and disorders have been reported
   in wild animals bred in captivity, but little attention has been paid
   to the particular genetic management problems that arise when such
   defects occur These problems include the obstacle of eliminating the
   deleterious allele(s) without contemporary loss of genetic variability.
   In this paper we use the statistical methods of pedigree analysis to
   address questions regarding a previously presumed hereditary form of
   blindness observed in a captive wolf population bred for conservation
   purposes in Scandinavian zoos. The most likely mode of inheritance
   coincides with an autosomal recessive allele with either a full
   penetrance or a reduced penetrance of 0.6 (depending on the reliability
   of studbook records). Using these two models of inheritance we
   calculate the probability of carrying the blindness allele for each
   living animal. Analysis of the effect of remOving high-probability
   carriers on founder allele survival and level of inbreeding
   demonstrates that the frequency of the deleterious allele can be
   significantly reduced without seriously affecting founder allele
   survival or current degree of inbreeding in the wolf population.

ID CANIS-LUPUS; WOLF CANIS; ODOR
AB A hypothesis generated from field observations of lions and tigers was
   tested in a zoo setting- The presence of a whitish material in urine
   marks, detected by visual inspection, led to the surmise that anal-sac
   secretions were expelled along with urine. This hypothesis was
   evaluated by labelling anal-sac secretions of various felids with an
   inert dye. The animals were monitored thereafter for signs of dye in
   urine-marks, on feces or in their enclosures. The failure to find
   anal-sac secretions in urine or on feces led to a search for an
   alternate explanation for the whitish material. A likely answer was
   found in the confirmation of considerable lipid in the bladder urine of
   lions and tigers, which separates to form a visible, whitish layer.
   Relative levels of urinary lipid reflect general condition of an animal
   as they correlate with kidney fat reserves (Hewer et al., 1948), so the
   amount of lipid in a scent mark could serve as an indicator of
   condition. Furthermore, because lipid retards the release of volatile
   compounds (Regnier and Goodwin, 1976), lipid in a scent mark will
   extend release time of a pheromonal message.

AB The food habits and dietary overlap of the Wolf and the Red fox were
   studied in an area of the Abruzzo National Park, Central Apennines
   (Italy), over a period of two years. The Wolf preyed mainly upon wild
   and domestic ungulates. The occurrence of Red deer in diet exceeded
   that of the Roe deer, parallel to the relative local abundance of these
   species. Although the consumption of reintroduced deer species
   increased during the study period, no corresponding decrease of
   predation on livestock could be assessed. The diet of the Wolf did not
   show seasonal variations in the study area, whereas that of the Fox
   did. The use of different trophic resources by these two Carnivores was
   likely to generate such a difference, the former taking prey steadily
   available throughout the year, while the latter makes use of seasonally
   fluctuating food resources (e.g. rodents and fruits). The dependence on
   anthropogenic food resources was noticeable for the Wolf, but mainly
   restricted to domestic ungulates, and negligible for the Fox. Food
   competition between these two Carnivores is unlikely in well preserved
   habitats. where they can fill different trophic niches.

ID WOLF PREDATION; DEER
AB Snow can affect wolf predation rates, diet composition, and scavenging,
   which are important components in understanding and managing wolf-prey
   systems. Thus, I located elk (Cervus elaphus) killed by gray wolves
   (Canis lupus, hereafter referred to as wolves) in Banff National Park,
   Alberta for 5 winters, and I followed one pack of wolves intensively
   throughout 1 winter to determine the effects of snow depth on wolf
   predation. Kill rate increased (P < 0.001) from 1 ungulate/5.4 days
   with no snow to 1 ungulate/1.1 days in snow 60 cm deep. Similar (P >
   0.5) numbers of calves (n = 24) and adults (n = 28) were killed in
   shallow snow; predominantly calves (9 of 11) were killed at
   intermediate snow depths that hindered calves but not adults; and only
   adults (n = 9) were killed in deep snow that hindered both age classes
   of elk. Scavenging of ungulate carcasses occurred at shallower (P <
   0.01) snow depths than did kills. At shallow snow depths, wolves likely

AB The structure is reported of bones of glacial-period mammals, which
   were found in 1973 to 1989 in gravel-sandy soil of the fossiliferous
   layer ''Rixdorfer Horizont'' at Niederlehme near Konigs Wusterhausen.
   The findings, probably, date from one of the interstages of the glacial
   period ''Weichsel-Kaltzeit'' before the stage ''Brandenburger
   Stadium''. Their embedding took place more than 20000 years ago.
   Changes of the deposit of bones and teeth from older sediments are not
   to exclude in the finding place Niederlehme. In the collection of
   findings with 102 skeletal parts are to define following species:
   Mammuthus primigenius, Coelodonta antiquitatis, Equus sp., Bison
   priscus, Megalocerus giganteus, Cervus elaphus, Rangifer tarandus and
   Canis lupus.
   A trajectorial direction of the trabecula in the substantia spongiosa
   is evident. There are also specific channels of blood vessels with
   different diameters. This channels have completely closed bone-wall
   (with a central venous sinus of diameter 5 to 10 mm) or in little
   vessels (diameter 1 to 3 mm), we have found many apertures to the rooms
   of the substantia spongiosa. The microscopical investigation of bones
   of Mammuthus primigenius has shown Havers' channels and perforating
   channels, Havers' systems and lacunae osseae.

AB We compared wolf (Canis lupus) reproductive data for March and April,

   lower (66% compared with greater-than-or-equal-to 96%, P < 0.001) when
   ungulate biomass per wolf was low versus moderate or high.
   Reproductively inactive adult females had significantly less

   ungulate biomass per wolf was relatively abundant. Average litter size,
   estimated by counting blastocysts or fetuses, declined significantly (P
   < 0.001), from 6.9 to 4.6, as ungulate biomass per wolf declined. We
   conclude that wolf productivity declines as prey availability per wolf
   declines. However, only when ungulate biomass per wolf declined below
   levels previously reported in the literature did we observe significant
   declines in reproductive potential. Ungulate biomass per wolf was low
   because of large, rapid declines in ungulates and lesser declines in
   wolves. We recognize that functional relationships, e.g., prey
   vulnerability and feeding dominance, can influence wolf productivity
   independently of ungulate biomass per wolf.

   territories were randomly located relative to territory centers.
   However, only 10.5% (2) of the dens were located within a 1-km-wide
   strip inside the territory boundaries, indicating possible avoidance of
   neighboring packs. A negative relationship (r2 = 0.27; P < 0.05)
   between territory size and den distance from territory center was
   found, indicating that in large territories wolves might select the
   denning site that minimizes travel distance from and to the den. Den
   use was traditional in 86% (6) of the denning alpha females studied for
   >1 year, and possibly the availability of a stable food source helped
   determine den location.

AB This paper reports aspects of a long-term study (1975-84) of the
   ecology, social organisation and behaviour of dingoes, Canis familiaris
   dingo, on the lower Fortescue River in Western Australia. In all, 170
   dingoes were fitted with radio-collars and tracked from aircraft.
   Dingoes were sighted during 59% of the 13 618 occasions that they were
   being radio-tracked during the day. Radio-tracking yielded 31 229
   daytime and 3016 night-time locations of radio-collared dingoes. The
   average duration of radio contact with 146 dingoes was 9 months (range
   1-35 months). Dingoes were most active around sunrise and sunset,
   moderately active during the night, and least active during the heat of
   the day. Travelling (local meandering and more purposeful movement) was
   the most commonly witnessed activity. Levels of scent-marking
   (raised-leg urination and ground-scratching), howling and general
   activity increased over the 2-3 months prior to the mating period,
   suggesting that dingoes may have a long pro-oestrus (1-2 months).
   Whelping took place from mid-May to mid-August (mean date 18 July). The
   characteristics of natal dens are described. The pattern of activities
   associated with pup-rearing, including alloparental behaviour, closely
   followed that of related canids.

AB Between 1975 and 1984, 105 radio-collared dingoes, Canis familiaris
   dingo, were tracked and observed from aircraft on the Fortescue River
   in Western Australia. Dingoes maintained strong site fidelity and
   seldom travelled far beyond their territories. In total, 81 forays
   (moves greater-than-or-equal-to 2 km beyond territory boundaries) were
   identified from 6598 independent locations of pack members; 80 were <
   10 km from territory boundaries. Forays involved individuals as well as
   small groups; 68.2% of 22 confirmed individual forays were made by
   males. Forays occurred in all seasons and years. Some forays appeared
   to be related to subsequent dispersal. A total of 25 dingoes dispersed
   as solitary individuals. Mean dispersal distance beyond known pack
   territories was 20.1 km (n = 19, range = 1.184 km). Males tended to
   disperse further than females and had a higher incidence of dispersal.
   Five groups of pack members and one entire pack also dispersed. The
   incidence of dispersal was highest when population density was high and
   food supply was low. Dispersal was facilitated by the availability of
   vacant areas. Humans caused much of the mortality of dispersing
   dingoes. The patterns of dispersal by individuals and groups, and the
   factors that influence them are similar for dingoes and the related
   canid, the wolf, Canis lupus. Control work in buffer zones must provide
   a satisfactory dispersal sink to minimise the risk of incursions by
   dingoes into livestock-grazing areas.

AB The release of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical hormones was
   studied in intact and neutered gray wolves (Canis lupus) to determine
   how these hormones interact and affect reproductive hormones.
   Experiments were performed on adult wolves anesthetized with 400 mg
   ketamine and 50 mg promazine. Intravenous (i.v.) injections with 50 mug
   ovine corticotropin releasing factor (oCRF) significantly increased
   adrenocorticotropin (ACTH; P less-than-or-equal-to 0.01), cortisol
   (CORT; P less-than-or-equal-to 0.004), and progesterone terone (P
   less-than-or-equal-to 0.036), but not beta-endorphin (P
   greater-than-or-equal-to 0.52). Since neutered wolves demonstrated
   dose-dependent elevations in response to ACTH, it was concluded that
   the progesterone was secreted from the adrenal gland. Basal luteinizing
   hormone (LH) concentrations in neutered wolves were similar before and
   60 min after i.v. injection of 1, 5, or 25 IU ACTH (P
   greater-than-or-equal-to 0.36) or 2.2 mg/kg cortisol (P = 0.42).
   Neither 25 IU ACTH (P = 0.55) nor 0.22 mg/kg dexamethasone (P = 0.49)
   altered the LH response to injection of LH releasing hormone in
   neutered wolves. Chronic administration of 0.22 mg/kg/day dexamethasone
   for 3 d did not alter baseline LH concentrations (P = 0.75). Injection
   of 1.0 mg/kg naloxone (NAL), however, increased LH concentrations
   relative to baseline values in both intact (P = 0.032) and neutered (P
   = 0.0005) female wolves, but not in intact (P = 0.19) or neutered males
   (P = 0.07). These results indicated that in gray wolves (1) oCRF
   stimulated the release of pituitary and adrenal hormones in a fashion
   similar to that of other mammals; (2) the adrenal cortex was capable of
   secreting progesterone into the systemic circulation; (3) exogenous
   glucocorticoids did not alter LH concentrations; and (4) endogenous
   opioids may modulate LH secretion in female wolves.

DT Article
AB Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), wolves (Canis lupus), and moose
   (Alces alces) were radio-collared and monitored in two areas of
   southeastern British Columbia to determine predator-prey interactions.
   Throughout the year, wolves and moose used similar areas and habitats,
   and moose were the primary prey of wolves. In winter most caribou used
   high-elevation habitats and were spatially separated from wolves and
   moose living in valley bottoms. In summer, caribou, wolves, and moose
   at Quesnel Lake used similar areas and habitats, whereas in Wells Gray
   Park most caribou migrated to rugged, mountainous areas, which kept
   them spatially separated from wolves and moose. The Quesnel Lake
   caribou population had a high adult mortality rate (29%/year), wolf
   predation being the major cause. Calf survival to October was low
   (2.5/100 adult females) when wolves were present and uncontrolled in
   the area, but was significantly greater (39/100 adult females) when
   wolves were reduced or absent. The Quesnel Lake caribou population was
   found to be declining by about 25%/year, and wolf predation appeared to
   be the major limiting factor. Caribou in Wells Gray Park had a low
   adult mortality rate (8%/year) and comparatively high calf survival to
   October (37/100 adult females). The Wells Gray caribou population was
   found to be slowly increasing, apparently because its migratory
   behavior kept it separated from wolves and moose throughout the year,
   resulting in low wolf predation on the caribou.

ID HERD
AB Most wolves (Canis lupus) on migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus)
   ranges in the Northwest Territories den near the tree line, the
   northern limit of tree growth. Sixty percent of the 209 dens that we
   located were within 50 km of the tree line, an area representing only
   25 % of the caribou range. Den density in the forest was significantly
   lower than expected if dens were randomly dispersed. Within the tundra
   zone wolves did not show any preference for denning near caribou
   calving grounds. Most wolves may den at the tree line because caribou
   are likely available for a greater proportion of the denning period
   than they would be elsewhere and because caribou are usually abundant
   near the tree line in September, when the nutritional demands of the
   pups are greatest. Within the tree-line zone, habitat characteristics
   appeared to affect the local distribution of dens because wolves
   preferred to den where the roots of trees and shrubs provided
   structural support for the tunnels. With most wolves denning at the
   tree line, density-dependent summer range expansion and contraction by
   caribou may provide a mechanism by which changing caribou densities
   could influence the growth rate of the wolf population.

ID PARENT OFFSPRING CONFLICT
AB If behavioral mechanisms controlling suckling have been shaped by
   parent-offspring conflict in the ultimate sense, then proximate
   behavioral determinants of conflict should occur throughout lactation,
   with greatest intensity in the terminal phase, and offspring should
   have tactics for overcoming parental resistance. We observed the

   Ellesmere Island, Canada, from estimated ages 5 through 10 weeks
   (including a continuous record for 192 h). The following variables
   declined with age: percentage of suckling bouts initiated by the
   nurser, persistence by pups, and mean duration of suckling bouts.
   Variables that increased with age were interbout interval, percentage
   of suckling bouts terminated by the nurser, and wincing or agonistic
   actions of the nurser. Behavioral conflict appeared in the
   developmental stage (estimated age 7 - 8 weeks) during which pups could
   feed on opened carcasses. Countertactics by pups to obtain milk were
   not apparent, although the pups developed diverse tactics for obtaining
   and sharing meat. In this group of wolves, weaning mechanisms were a
   complex function of food delivery by adults, discomfort of the nursing
   female as pups developed, and declining persistence of pups. If there
   is a conflict over what is optimal for pups and for the nurser in the
   ultimate sense, behavioral conflict is more likely to be expressed with
   regard to access to meat, or as conditional tactics dependent on food
   availability, rather than weaning conflict being controlled by fixed
   rules in this species.

AB The wolf, listed as vulnerable internationally, remains in 85% of its
   former total Canadian range, numbering very roughly 58 500 animals. A
   classification by ecotype based upon prey-base and parallel geographic-
   or biome-base is proposed for conservation planning. An annual kill by
   humans of 7% (1 in 14) was calculated from most recent available
   statistics. Wolves are protected by legislation or policy from hunting
   and trapping in only 12 places in Canada, representing 1.2% of wolf

AB Den site attendance and activity patterns of Gray Wolves within two
   wolf packs in southcentral Alaska were studied in 1980 and 1981 using a
   combination of activity radio transmitters and direct observations from
   blinds and fixed-wing aircraft. One wolf pack was electronically
   monitored for 17 continuous days in 1980 and another for 43 continuous
   days in 1981. They were observed for 277 and 369 hours, respectively.
   Alpha females spent more time at dens than other pack members. The
   alpha female of a pack of four adult wolves spent less time at the den
   than did the alpha female from a pack of eight adult wolves suggesting
   that in smaller packs, alpha females may have a more active role in
   providing food for pups. Den attendance by other pack members was
   highly variable. Yearling males tended to avoid dens until after
   parturition. Yearling females from the large pack tended to spend more
   time at the den than those from a smaller pack. When pups were from 2-7
   weeks of age, they were left unattended from 5-15% of the time. There
   was a high probability that groups of wolves would be present at the
   den during mid-day. Wolves tended to depart from the den between 2100
   and 2400 h and arrive between 2100 and 0400 h.

TI WOLF RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION IN ITALY
SO BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The development of research and conservation activities for the wolf
   Canis lupus in Italy from 1972 to 1989 is described. Initial studies
   indicated that the Italian population was fragmented into a number of
   'island' populations on mountain ranges with little interchange between
   them. Radio-tracking studies showed that groups were small (usually
   2-4, maximum 7) with a home range of 200-400 km2. Wolves were
   nocturnal, obtained 60-70% of their food from garbage dumps and avoided
   contact with man. The main conflicts between man and wolves are:
   livestock killing; competition and interbreeding with feral dogs; and
   availability of habitat and food.
   The wolf has been strictly protected since 1976 and has increased its
   range in Italy. Changes in agricultural practice have increased the
   risks of successful attacks on livestock, but compensation is paid for
   damage done by wolves. Natural prey species are being reintroduced into
   key areas of the wolf's range to improve food availability. A national
   public awareness campaign has greatly improved the wolf's image.
   The greatest threat to long-term conservation of the wolf is
   interbreeding and, to a lesser extent, competition with Italy's
   population of 80 000 feral dogs. A captive breeding programme is being
   established with the goal of maintaining 90% of the Italian wolf's
   genetic variability for the next 200 years.

ID ONTARIO
AB Allopatric distribution of wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (C.
   latrans) in some areas of North America can be explained by competitive
   exclusion of coyotes by wolves. However, in Riding Mountain National
   Park, Manitoba, the potential for competition between the two species
   was minimized by differential use of nonlimiting food resources. Wolves
   primarily preyed on elk (Cervus elaphus) and white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus), and secondarily on moose (Alces alces).
   Coyotes preyed on deer and rarely, young elk. Although wolves
   occasionally killed coyotes, coyotes followed wolves and scavenged at
   their kills. The benefits accrued from scavenging apparently
   compensated for the associated risk of being killed by wolves.

AB The distribution. status and conservation problems of the wolf Canis
   lupus in Spain were studied in 1987 and 1988. Wolves regularly occurred
   over 100,000 km2, mainly in the northwest quarter of the country, with
   an estimated 294 breeding pairs, i.e. 1,500 and 2,000 wolves in early
   spring and autumn, respectively, For 1987, reports were received of 309
   wolves killed in Spain (excluding Asturias) but the actual number could
   range from 550 to 750 every year, mostly illegal killings. Annual
   damage to livestock was estimated at nearly one million US $, losses
   being disproportionately high in mountain areas due to the lack of
   protection of free-ranging livestock. The number of stray dogs is
   higher where wolves are absent and no extensive wolf-dog hybridization
   has been recorded. Problems related to wolf management are discussed.

   were uncommon in coyotes. The most frequent injuries in coyotes were
   related to gunshot wounds. Four coyotes had been killed but not eaten

   Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) quills contributed to the death of a

   were identified as dispersers.  Both sexes dispersed equally.  Of the
   adults, yearlings, and pups, 8, 75, and 16%, respectively, dispersed. 
   Most dispersers left when they were 11-12 months old, only a few wolves
   dispersing as adults.  Dispersal occurred mainly in February-April and
   October-November.  Adults dispersed short distances into nearby
   territories, but yearlings and pups dispersed both short and long
   distances.  Yearling and pup dispersal rates were highest when the wolf
   population was increasing or decreasing and low when the population was
   stable.  Adults had the highest pairing and denning success, yearlings
   had moderate pairing and low denning success, and pups had low pairing
   and denning success.  Yearlings and pups that dispersed a short
   distance had a higher success of settling in a new territory, likely
   reflecting available vacancies in nearby territories.  Thirty-five
   percent of the known-age wolves remained in their natal territory for >
   2 years; two wolves were known to have remained for > 7 years.  The
   relative weight of pups at capture apparently did not affect their age

AB Comparative studying of ways of odor labeling and its comparison with
   the phylogeny of mustelides allow to mark out two main pathways in the

   different specific ways of leaving urine while more social species
   (Melinae) are characterized by leaving of secretion from a special
   subcaudal gland.  There are several stages which can be isolated in the
   process of evolution:  leaving of urine together with excrement
   (arrangement of <<lavatories>>), expansion of the area labeled with
   urine (splashing of urine and leaving of <<urinary paths>>), and
   application of urine to fatty base (fatty secretion of cutaneous glands
   or secretion of a specific abdominal gland).  The main trend in
   mediated chemocommunication is the increased efficiency of odor label
   findings by conspecific mustelides at more economic expenditure of
   water with urine.

   greater for male and female yearlings and adult females outside

   December 1987 to March 1989. Wolf signs were looked for along 22
   transects representative of the different habitat types of the study
   area in order to define seasonal differences in habitat use. Scats were
   collected and analysed to identify the main food items used by wolves
   in each season. Changes in range surface area were recorded in
   different seasons in relation to food availability and territoriality
   of the wolves. Pastures and bushy areas were selected in all seasons,
   while mixed woods were used only in autumn and conifer reafforestations
   in winter and spring. Beech woods and arable land were avoided all year
   round. The main food items of the wolves were fruit (Rosaceae),
   livestock and wild boar. Fruit was above all in winter and spring,
   livestock (sheep and calves) mainly in summer during the grazing period
   and wild boar all year round. The presence of the wolves in northern
   Italy is only partially dependent on food sources of human origin but
   these are of fundamental importance during the period of pup rearing.

   CENTRAL ALASKA; RED DEER; DENSITY; WOLVES; SURVIVAL
AB The wide acceptance of predation as the major limiting and/or
   regulatory factor on moose (Alces alces) populations is premature
   because assumptions have not been addressed, alternative hypotheses
   have not been given similar consideration, and adequate experiments
   have not been conducted.  I evaluated the empirical information
   available to assess the role of predation in the population dynamics of
   North American moose.  Studies that estimated losses of adult moose to
   wolves (Canis lupus), or monitored losses by radio telemetry, indicate
   that wolf predation is a limiting factor with a magnitude equal to or
   less than other sources of mortality (particularly hunting).  Three
   studies found that brown (Ursus arctos) and black (Ursus americanus)
   bears can take 50% of calves and that these losses represent the most
   significant mortality factor.  Predation rates by wolves or bears
   generally do not seem to be density dependent.  Experimental reduction
   of wolves produced increases in calf survival in 2 of 5 cases, but
   significant increases in density in only 1 instance.  Bears have been
   removed in 3 instances and calf survival has been improved in each
   case.  I reviewed 4 predator-moose hypotheses and outlined their
   specific predictions.  Presently, empirical data are inadequate to test
   among them, and 2 experiments are required to do so.  Moose densities
   should be reduced in one and bears and wolves should be removed in
   another; both should be followed by monitoring of changes in moose
   population.

ID POPULATION-DYNAMICS; WOLF PREDATION; CARIBOU; ALBERTA; WINTER; WEIGHT;
   WOLVES; RESOURCES; ROCHESTER; RATES
AB We address 3 major questions facing wildlife managers and wildlife
   users of northern ecosystems:  (1) Why do moose (Alces alces) often
   remain at low densities relative to K carrying capacity (KCC) in
   lightly harvested systems?  (2) What is the range of potential moose
   harvest yields from these northern systems?  and (3) What are some
   steps that can reduce the controversy over management of moose, wolves
   (Canis lupus), and bears (Ursus arctos and U. americanus)?  We assessed
   the roles that nutrition, snow, harvest, disease, and predation played
   in limiting moose densities in a 9,700-km2 area in east-central Alaska
   during 1948-88.  Our intensive study occurred during 1981-88, and we
   reviewed and reanalyzed historical data.  We also present published and
   unpublished moose, wolf, and bear inventory data and moose harvest data
   from 35 other areas.
   We identified predation by wolves and bears as the major factor
   limiting moose at low densities in the experimental area during
   1976-88.  Moose irrupted simultaneously with a predator reduction
   program (1948-60) that included poisoning.  The subsequent decline of
   moose ended about 1976, at which time wolves declined and survival of
   moose increased.  During the mid-1980's and after the recent wolf
   reduction (1981-83), we estimated that predators annually killed 31% of
   the postcalving moose population, compared with 6% killed by factors
   other than predation and 1.5% by humans.  We concluded that mortality
   due to predation had a substantial additive component during the
   low-density phase.
   Data from throughout Alaska and Yukon indicate that where wolves and
   bears were near KCC and moose were a primary prey, moose populations
   were within a low-density dynamic equilibrium (LDDE) (xBAR = 148, range
   = 45-417 moose/1,000 km2 of moose habitat).  Moose usually attained
   elevated densities (xBAR = 663, range = 169-1,447 moose/1,000 km2)
   where humans held wolves and/or bears below KCC.  These elevated moose
   populations yielded approximate sustainable harvests of 20-130
   moose/1,000 km3 compared with 0-18/1,000 km2 in systems with predators
   near KCC.
   We describe several options and recommendations aimed at reducing the
   controversy over managing predation to elevate moose harvest.  One
   management option, after moose reach elevated levels, is to maintain
   wolves at densities found in systems without predation management. 
   Greater public participation in the development of wildlife management
   plans is recommended if conservationists are to unite in addressing the
   most serious long-term threat to moose-wolf-bear systems, i.e. the loss
   of habitat.

   Three levels of activity could be detected. The Wildlink system
   provided greater activity discrimination and was more reliable,

AB We examined weights and hematologic profiles of gray wolf (Canis lupus)
   pups and the associated wolf density in the east-central Superior
   National Forest of northeastern Minnesota (USA) during 1970 to 1988. We
   collected weight and hematologic data from 117 pups (57 females, 60
   males) during 1 September to 22 November each year. The wolf density
   (wolves/800 km2) trend was divided into three phases: high (72 +/- 7),
   1970 to 1975; medium (44 +/- 2), 1976 to 1983; and low (27 +/- 2), 1984
   to 1988. Wolf numbers declined (P = 0.0001) 39 and 63% from 1970 to
   1975 to 1976 to 1983 and from 1970 to 1975 to 1984 to 1988,
   respectively. Weight was similar between male and female pups and did
   not vary as wolf density changed. Mean hemoglobin (P = 0.04), red (P =
   0.0001) and white blood cells (P = 0.002), mean corpuscular volume,
   mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular
   hemoglobin (P = 0.0001) did differ among the multi-annual phases of
   changing wolf density. Weight and hematologic data also were compared
   to values from captive wolf pups. The high, but declining wolf density
   was associated with macrocytic, normochromic anemia in wolf pups,
   whereas the lowest density coincided with a hypochromic anemia.
   Although hematologic values show promise for assessing wolf pup
   condition and wolf population status, they must be used cautiously
   until data are available from other populations.

AB The objectives of this study were to describe the scent-marking
   behavior of sympatric wolves and coyotes, and determine whether scent
   marking has an interspecific behavioral significance and, if so,
   whether it is involved in maintaining ecological separation of the two
   species.  The hypotheses tested were that coyotes travelling within
   active wolf areas reduce their frequency of marking and avoid wolf
   scent marks, and that wolves react to sympatric coyotes as
   transgressing conspecifics, and increase their scent marking.  Marking
   by the two species was similar, both canids using the same scent
   mounds.  Coyotes did not avoid areas marked by wolves, nor did they
   minimize evidence of their own activity.  Coyotes increased their
   marking significantly in response to wolves.  Wolves, however, did not
   respond to marks by coyotes.

   overall pattern of few deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations and
   some spatial heterogeneity was observed.  Wolves associated with
   different caribou herds exhibited a low level of differentiation (F(ST)

   1907) - A NEW ANALYSIS OF STOMACHS DATA
SO MAMMALIA
LA English
DT Article
ID FOOD-HABITS; SPAIN
AB The diet of the Iberian Wolf (Canis lupus signatus Cabrera, 1907) was
   studied in five ecologically different areas that together cover the
   whole range of distribution of the species in Spain.  The study
   material included 251 stomach contents and some dropping samples
   collected between 1970 and 1985.  Results are given in terms of
   frequency and percentage of biomass for each food item.
   Estimation of the biomass consumed was based on the weight of the fresh
   remains found in the stomachs.  This method, in contrast with the
   conventional procedure of assigning standard weights, enabled
   quantification of carrion.
   To determine whether a food remain corresponded to a whole animal or to
   offal, an index of the nature of food was used.  This index indicates
   the mean portion of food consumed for each item.  In each area, the
   highest index values corresponded to wild or domestic ungulates which
   constitute the stapple prey of the wolf, or to whole carcasses obtained
   from industrial farms, whereas low index values corresponded to animal
   remains obtained in dumps.
   By weighing the index of the nature of food with the biomass percentage
   of each food item in the diet, an index of food availability was
   estimated.  The values obtained for each area concurred with their
   respective abundance of resources.
   Likewise, an analysis was made on the mean gut weight in each area and
   related to differences in the amount of food consumed by wolves. 
   Results concurred with the availability values of the food, but not
   with the degree of population expansion, which seems to be more
   dependent on the pressure of human control efforts.
   There are important differences in the wolf's diet from one area to
   another, but the dependence on domestic and/or wild ungulates is common
   to all areas studied.  In area I (West Galicia), the diet is centered
   on the prey groups most often associated with human activities, wild
   prey being almost absent from the diet.  In this area the wolf lives
   upon scraps from industrial poultry and pig farms, and domestic
   ungulates.
   In the area II (Cantabrian Mountains) and IV (Demanda Mountains), the
   diet is more diversified, ranging from an almost exclusive dependence
   on wild ungulates with domestic ungulates as a complementary prey, to
   the opposite situation.
   The area III (Douro Meseta) is a particular environment in that the
   lagomorphs were added to the conventional prey groups, according to
   season, sometimes becoming as important as these.
   In area V, wolves in Extremadura prey on both wild and domestic
   ungulates, while in Sierra Morena they prey almost exclusively on big
   game.
   The diet of young wolves was studied separately and compared with that
   of older individuals.  In both groups, domestic ungulates had similar
   importance, but young wolves consumed more chickens, arthropods and

AB (1) I examined the significance of food competition, wolf predation
   (canis lupus), and snow accumulation as limiting or regulating factors
   of moose (Alces alces) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). 
   That is, I assessed the contribution of those factors in creating
   year-to-year variations in animal abundance, or in generating density
   dependence.
   (2) I used long-term data on the demography of moose on Isle Royale,
   Michigan, and deer in the National Superior Forest, north-eastern
   Minnesota.
   (3) Wolf predation and food competition explained 80% of the
   interannual variation of moose abundance.  Snow accumulation had no
   quantifiable effect moose numbers.  Competition for food, but not wolf
   predation and snow, had a regulatory impact on moose.
   (4) Wolf predation was inversely related to moose density and the
   relationship differed between periods of moose expansion and reduction.
    The dual density relationship of wolf predation may explain population
   cyclicity of moose at elevated densities.
   (5) Significant inverse relationships were found between deer
   population growth and relative wolf density, as well as with deer
   density.  Snow had no measurable effect on deer numbers, possibly
   because of extremely low deer densities and the predominant impact of
   wolf predation.
   (6) A previous suggestion that snow accumulation during consecutive
   winters creates a cumulative impact on the nutritional status of deer
   and moose was not supported.

   against Leptospira interrogans using a microtiter agglutination test. 
   Twelve serovars included in the study were:  australis, autumnalis,

   in decreasing order was:  grippotyphosa, bratislava, autumnalis,
   canicola, pomona, ballum, pyrogenes, hardjo, and copenhageni.  No
   antibodies were found against australis, bataviae, and tarassovi. 
   These results indicate that L. interrogans infection may occur in

AB Wolf (Canis lupus) activity and interactions with white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) were monitored in north central Minnesota
   during six winters in which mean January-February snow depth alternated
   between shallow (19-26 cm) and relatively deep (40-47 cm) and winters
   (winter severity index; L.J. Verme. 1968. J. Wildl.  Manage. 32: 
   566-574) alternated between mild (71-98) and moderately severe
   (126-137).  Wolves traveled farther and more often and spent less time
   with other pack members in mild than in severe winters.  Radio-marked
   wolves and deer used conifer cover less, and fewer deer were killed
   there, when snow was shallow.  Similarly, fewer wolf-killed deer were
   found in and near deer concentration areas during mild winters.  Of the
   74 deer killed by wolves, the proportion that were fawns (54%) differed
   from the proportion of fawns in the winter population (27%), but
   neither varied with winter severity.  Few deer killed by wolves
   appeared debilitated.  Carcass consumption was high in all winters,
   regardless of their severity, but wolves scavenged less in mild than in
   severe winters (10 vs. 29% of deer carcasses observed).  Thus, wolves
   changed winter activity, movement patterns, sociality, and feeding
   behavior in response to snow-induced changes in deer distribution and
   mobility.

TI INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN A CAPTIVE WOLF (CANIS-LUPUS) POPULATION
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Uncertainty currently exists regarding the extent to which mammalian
   carnivores suffer from inbreeding depression.  In particular, it has
   been proposed that wolves and species with a similar social structure
   are adapted to close inbreeding.  Empirical data, however, are scarce. 
   This paper provides strong evidence against the contention that natural
   populations of wolves are resistant to inbreeding depression.  We
   analyzed studbook data of a captive wolf population bred in
   Scandinavian zoos and found negative effects of inbreeding expressed as
   reductions in juvenile weight, reproduction, and longevity.  The
   occurrence of an apparently hereditary form of blindness is also
   associated with inbreeding.  Different effects of inbreeding can be
   attributed to genes originating from different founder pairs, thus
   indicating that alleles that are deleterious in the homozygous state
   are fairly common in natural wolf populations.

   Canis lupus, ibex Capra ibex and bharal Pseudois nayaur have an almost
   continuous distribution throughout; Ladakh urial Ovis vignei, Tibetan
   argali Ovis ammon, wild ass Equus kiang and brown bear Ursus arctos
   have a limited distribution.  Snow leopard prefer lower altitudes and
   rocky, undisturbed areas.  Ibex and bharal occupy similar rocky
   habitats but their ranges are mostly separate, with a small area of
   overlap.  The Ladakh urial shows signs of recovery from an earlier
   decline.  Natural resources are widely used for fuel, fodder and
   grazing, but favourable factors include a low human population, low
   level of hunting and the existence of some uninhabited and undisturbed
   areas.  A comprehensive Protected Area Network has been proposed.

ID CALF MORTALITY; WOLF PREDATION; BROWN BEAR; MOVEMENTS; CARIBOU;
   MINNESOTA; PATTERNS; SUMMER; RANGE; RATES
AB Demography, movements, and habitat use of moose (Alces alces) were
   studied in south-central Alaska from 1976 through early 1986 and
   historical data were reviewed.  Initially this study tested the
   hypothesis that predation by wolves (Canis lupus) was limiting moose
   population growth.  When reductions in wolf densities failed to greatly
   increase calf moose survival, we attempted to directly identify and
   quantify causes of calf and adult moose mortality.  Concurrently, we
   sought to quantify movements, habitat use, productivity, and the
   effects of severe winters.  Lastly, we tested the hypothesis that
   predation by brown bears (Ursus arctos) was limiting moose population
   growth.
   During 1976 through 1985, 218 neonates, 61 calves 5-10 months of age,
   and 184 adults were captured and either radio collared or equipped with
   visual collars.  The moose population was estimated at 710 moose/1,000
   km2 in 1980, and at 844 moose/1,000 km2 in 1983 (lambda = 1.06). 
   Average age of adult cow moose was 7.7 years.  Pregnancy rates averaged
   81%.  Twinning rates averaged 38%.  Parturition occurred between 18 May
   and mid-June.  Overall, calf sex ratios were not different from 1:1
   except in 1977 when males predominated.
   Survival through 5 months of age averaged 39% with twin and single
   calves having similar survival rates.  Predation accounted for 83% of
   total mortality among neonates.  Ninety-six percent of natural
   mortality occurred during the first 6 weeks of life with brown bears
   accounting for 73% of the mortality.  During severe winters, males 6-12
   months of age had lower survival rates than females of similar ages. 
   Annual calf survival rates averaged 94% and 31% for females and males,
   respectively.  Yearling and adult female annual survival rates averaged
   94 and 95%, respectively.  Bulls > 2 years of age had low rates of
   natural (excluding hunting) mortality.
   Average size of moose groups containing radio-collared individuals was
   greatest in October and lowest in August.  Major periods of moose
   movement occurred during automn and spring migration and during rut
   (late Sep-Oct).  Total home range sizes for migratory moose averaged
   505 km2, whereas those for resident moose averaged 290 km2.  Nine of 15
   radio-collared offspring (mean age = 14 months) partially or fully
   dispersed from the cow's home range.  Males dispersed more frequently
   and had larger home ranges than females.
   Spruce (Picea spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) vegetation types were used
   disproportionately more than their availability.  During winter, areas
   with relatively low browse biomass were heavily used by moose, because
   browse was more available due to shallow snow depths.

AB We studied sodium-22 (Na-22) turnover as a means of estimating food
   intake in 6 captive, adult gray wolves (Canis lupus) (2 F, 4 M) over a
   31-day feeding period.  Wolves were fed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) meat only.  Mean mass-specific exchangeable Na pool was
   44.8 +/- 0.7 mEq/kg; there was no difference between males and females.
    Total exchangeable Na was related (r2 = 0.85, P < 0.009) to body mass.
    Overall, Na-22 turnover overestimated Na intake by 9.8 +/- 2.4% after
   32 days.  Actual Na intake was similar in males and females; however,
   Na turnover (P < 0.05) and the discrepancy (P < 0.01) between turnover
   and actual Na intake were greater in females than males.  From Day 8 to
   the end of the study, the absolute difference (mEq) between Na intake
   and Na turnover remained stable.  Sodium turnover (mEq/kg/day) was a
   reliable (r2 = 0.91, P < 0.001) estimator of food consumption
   (g/kg/day) in wolves over a 32-day period.  Sampling blood and weighing
   wolves every 1-4 days permitted identification of several potential
   sources of error, including changes in size of exchangeable Na pools,
   exchange of Na-22 with gastrointestinal and bone Na, and rapid loss of
   the isotope by urinary excretion.
